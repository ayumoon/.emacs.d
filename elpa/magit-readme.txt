Magit is a text-based Git user interface that puts an unmatched focus
on streamlining workflows.  Commands are invoked using short mnemonic
key sequences that take the cursorâ€™s position in the highly actionable
interface into account to provide context-sensitive behavior.

With Magit you can do nearly everything that you can do when using Git
on the command-line, but at greater speed and while taking advantage
of advanced features that previously seemed too daunting to use on a
daily basis.  Many users will find that by using Magit they can become
more effective Git user.
